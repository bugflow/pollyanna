Tooling
============

TODO:

* link to pollyanna_, github, zenhub, etc
* instructions for updating documents (update GitHub/ZenHub, these docs are generated)
* generate a list of all repositories associated with the project
* group by repository type

.. _pollyanna: https://github.com/bugflow/pollyanna
  
Repository types:

* singular project reposotiry (i.e. small project)
* sub-project repository (objective repo)
* component repository
* product repository

Note/Explain that:

* project repositories are ephemeral,
  they exist for the time-span of the project,
  and then become archived historical artefacts.
* component/product repositories are workplaces,
  they exist for the time span of the component or product.
  They may have existed before and after the project.
  Sometimes a project will decomission a component or product.

This page may be a good place to explain the high-level component architecture.
